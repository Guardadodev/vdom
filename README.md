# vdom
A small vdom implementation based on https://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx/ 

```
npm i
mkdir build
npm run build
npm run start
```

NOTE: https://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx/ is hands down the best beginner friendly intro to how the vdom works, 10/10. For something a little more advanced I recommend https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/
